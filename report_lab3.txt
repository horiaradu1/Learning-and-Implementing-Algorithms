This file has been provided to help you structure your write-up of Lab 3, Part c. Some questions can be answered with a single sentence, some may require much longer answers. You are free to edit/rearrange this file as much as you want.

All questions should be answered for each of your chosen data structures. 


------------------------
Initial Expectations
------------------------


>> Do you expect this data structure to be preferable to the others on all inputs, most  inputs, some inputs? Why?



>> Do you expect your answer to change if the dictionary is in the best/worst case for sorting? Why?



>> Can you phrase what you expect in terms of a one or two sentence hypothesis that you can test?


------------------------
Experimental Design
------------------------


>> How are you going to define what it means for one data stucture to be preferable to another?



>> Which conditions will you vary in your experiment? 



>> How will you vary them? Why did you make these choices? Did you use theoretical complexities, best, worst and average cases to inform your decisions?



>> How will you generate the data for your experiments?



>> How will you validate your findings?



------------------------
Results and Analysis
------------------------


>> What results did you record?


>> What does this tell you about the performance of the data structure?


>> What is the answer to the question "Under what conditions is it preferable to use this data structure?"
